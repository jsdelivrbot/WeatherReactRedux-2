# WeatherReactRedux

This is a React and Redux app that I created in conjunction with Stephen Grider's course Modern React with Redux.

It allows users to search for a city in the US, and displays the weekly temperature, humidity, pressure, and a 
google map embed of the location. It generates this information using the Google Maps API and the OpenWeatherAPI. It uses Sparklines to generate the graphs.
